AI3013 Machine Learning Course Project<br>Description:<br>This is a GROUP project (each group should have 4-6 students), which aims at applying <br>machine learning models as well as machine learning techniques (including but not limited <br>to those covered in our lectures) to solve complex real-world tasks using Python.<br>Notice: This project should differ from the one you are undertaking in the Machine Learning <br>Workshop Course.<br>Notice on Deep Learning Models:<br>You may decide to work on Deep learning models, and since our course mainly focus on <br>machine learning models and techniques, deep learning model not be considered as more <br>superior than other machine learning models if you just repeat a model that is designed by <br>others. Also, training deep learning models can be very time consuming, so make sure you have <br>the necessary computing resources.<br>Project Requirement:<br>Problem Selection:<br>• Choose a real-world problem from a domain of interest (e.g., healthcare, finance, <br>image recognition, natural language processing, etc.).<br>• Describe the problem, including data sources and the type of machine learning model <br>that will be applied (e.g., regression, classification, clustering, etc.).<br>Dataset Selection:<br>• Choose a dataset from public repositories (e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, <br>Kaggle) suitable for this topic.<br>• Ensure the dataset has a sufficient number of samples and features to allow for <br>meaningful analysis and model comparison.<br>• Apply appropriate data preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, encoding <br>categorical features, scaling).<br>Model Theory and Implementation:<br>• Select and implement at least 2 machine learning models for comparison.<br>• Provide a comprehensive explanation of the theoretical background of the chosen <br>models (e.g., loss functions, optimization techniques, and assumptions).<br>• Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen models.<br>• Include mathematical derivations where relevant (e.g., gradient descent for linear <br>regression).<br>• Implement the selected models From Scratch without using any existing machine <br>learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.). The implementation <br>should be done in Python using only basic libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and <br>Matplotlib.<br>Model Evaluation:<br>• Evaluate each model using suitable metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, <br>RMSE) for the problem.<br>• Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness and avoid overfitting.<br>• Analyze the behavior. of the models based on the dataset, including bias-variance <br>trade-offs, overfitting, and underfitting.<br>Analysis and Comparison:<br>• Compare the models in terms of:<br>o Performance (accuracy, precision, etc.).<br>o Computational complexity (training time, memory usage).<br>o Suitability for the dataset (e.g., which model performs best, why).<br>• Provide a comparison of the models' performances with appropriate visualizations <br>(e.g., bar plots or tables comp代 写AI3013、Python
程序aring metrics).<br>• Discuss how the assumptions of each model affect its suitability for the problem.<br>Submission Requirement:<br>Upon completion, each group must submit the following materials:<br>1. Progress report<br>a) Abstract<br>b) Introduction: problem statement, motivation and background of the topic<br>c) Related works and existing techniques of the topic<br>d) Methodology<br>e) Progress/Current Status<br>f) Next Steps and Plan for Completion<br>2. Project report, your report should contain but not limited to the followingcontent:<br>a) Abstract<br>b) Introduction: problem statement, motivation and background of the topic<br>c) Related works and existing techniques of the topic<br>d) Methodology<br>e) Experimental study and result analysis<br>f) Future work and conclusion<br>g) References<br>h) Contribution of each team member<br>3. Link and description to the Dataset and the implementation code.<br>4. Your final report should be a minimum of 9 pages and a maximum of 12 pages<br>5. For the final report, the similarity check Must Not exceed 20%, and the AI generation <br>content check Must Not exceed 25%.<br>6. Put all files (including: source code, presentation ppt and project report) into a ZIP file, <br>then submit it on iSpace.<br>Deadlines:<br> Team Information should be submitted by the end of Week 3.<br> The Progress Report should be submitted by the end of Week 10.<br> The Presentation will be arranged in Weeks 13 and 14 of this semester.<br> Final Project Report should be submitted by Friday of Week 15 (May.23.2025).<br>Assessment:<br>In general, projects will be evaluated based on:<br> Significance. (Did the authors choose an interesting or a “real" problem to work on, or <br>only a small “toy" problem? Is this work likely to be useful and/or haveimpact?)<br> The technical quality of the work. (i.e., Does the technical material make sense? Are <br>the things tried reasonable? Are the proposed algorithms or applications clever and <br>interesting? Do the student convey novel insight about the problem and/or algorithms?)<br> The novelty of the work. (Do you have any novel contributions, e.g., new model, new <br>technique, new method, etc.? Is this project applying a common technique to a well studied problem, or is the problem or method relatively unexplored?)<br> The workload of the project. (The workload of your project may depend on but not <br>limit to the following aspects: the complexity of the problem; the complexity of your <br>method; the complexity of the dataset; do you test your model on one or multiple <br>datasets? do you conduct a thorough experimental analysis on your model?)<br>Evaluation Percentage:<br> Progress Report: 5%<br> Final Report: 40%<br> Presentation: 40% (Each group will have 15-20 minutesfor presentation, and<br>each student must present no less than 3 minutes)<br> Code: 15%<br>It is YOUR responsibility to make sure:<br> Your submitted files can be correctly opened. <br> Your code can be compiled and run. <br>Late submission = 0; Plagiarism (cheating) = F<br><br><br>加QQ：99515681  WX：codinghelp  Email: 99515681@qq.com
